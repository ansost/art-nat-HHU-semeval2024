This repository provides the code and data for our solution for subtask A of shared task 8 of SemEval 2024 for classifying human- and machine-written texts in English across multiple domains. We propose a fusion model consisting of RoBERTa based pre-classifier and two MLPs that have been trained to correct the pre-classifier using linguistic features. Our model achieves an accuracy of 85\% and ranks 26th out of 141 participants. 

## Requirements
The code is written for Python 3.11. The required packages can be installed via pip using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
The data for the task can be downloaded from the [official Task repository](https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SemEval2024-task8). The data should be placed in the `data/` directory. The test set must be re-named to include the word `test` to match the dev and train files. 

Additional word lists need to be downloaded into the datafolder: 
- [negative words list](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mkulakowski2/4289441/raw/dad8b64b307cd6df8068a379079becbb3f91101a/negative-words.txt)
- [octanove vocabulary profile](https://github.com/openlanguageprofiles/olp-en-cefrj/blob/master/octanove-vocabulary-profile-c1c2-1.0.csv)
- [cefrj vocabulary profile](https://github.com/openlanguageprofiles/olp-en-cefrj/blob/master/cefrj-vocabulary-profile-1.5.csv)

## Usage
1. Use the scripts in `code/features/` to compute the features for the training, dev, and test data. Optionally, merge them using `code/merge_features.py`.
2. Run `code/finetune_transformer.ipynb` to fine-tune the RoBERTa model (pre-classifier) and obtain predictions, logits and hidden states. 
3. Finally, use `code/submission.ipynb` to replicate the final submission results.
